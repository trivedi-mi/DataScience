        "Stroke is a medical disorder in which the blood arteries in the brain are ruptured, causing damage to the brain. When the supply of blood and other nutrients to the brain is interrupted, symptoms might develop. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the greatest cause of death and disability globally. Early recognition of the various warning signs of a stroke can help reduce the severity of the stroke.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stroke occurs when the blood flow to various areas of the brain is disrupted or diminished, resulting in the cells in those areas of the brain not receiving the nutrients and oxygen they require and dying. A stroke is a medical emergency that requires urgent medical attention. Early detection and appropriate management are required to prevent further damage to the affected area of the brain and other complications in other parts of the body.\n",
        "\n",
        "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 15 million people worldwide suffer from strokes each year, with one person dying every 4-5 minutes in the affected population. Stroke is the 16 leading cause of mortality in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1]. Stroke is a noncommunicable disease that kills approximately 11% of the population.\n",

We can have False negative here but cannot afford false positive in case of heart attacks and thats why recall is important."
